# Plagiarism Detector Project

This repo contains my attempt for the "Plagiarism Detector" Project for the Udacity Nanodegree entitled "Machine Learning Engineer".

All the code in this repository is released under the MIT license.

As you may expect, the folder `Original_Project`contains the original code from the Udacity repo (https://github.com/udacity/ML_SageMaker_Studies). No changes were made there and it should be considered as a basis.

The actual usable (and reviewable) code is located inside the `Project`.
